## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- SQL Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.)
- Database management tool (phpMyAdmin, pgAdmin, DBeaver, etc.)
- Optional: Data visualization tool (Power BI, Tableau, Excel)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

###  Load Data
- All raw data files are stored in the `DATA` folder (`marketing_campaigns_dataset.csv`).
- Import the dataset into your SQL database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQL Server).

Example (PostgreSQL):
```sql
COPY marketing_campaigns FROM 'path_to_file/marketing_campaigns.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```

##  Run SQL Scripts

- Open the SQL Script folder and execute files in order:

1. `01_data_cleaning_marketing_campaigns.sql `

2. `02_ctr_by_channel.sql`

3. `03_campaign_type_conversion.sql`

4. `04_company_avg_roi.sql`

5. `05_roi_by_channel.sql`

6. `06_roi_by_segment.sql`

7. `07_roi_engagement_by_location.sql`  

8. `08_roi_by_duration.sql`

9. `09_combined_channel_segment_analysis.sql`

-Each script runs a specific part of the analysis (CTR, ROI, conversion rate, engagement, etc.).

##  View Results

- Run each script to generate query outputs in your SQL editor.

- Export the results to Power BI, Tableau, or Excel for visualization.

- Example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM roi_by_channel_results;
```
##  Optional Visualization

- Connect your database to Power BI or Tableau.

- Create charts for ROI by channel, conversion rate, and customer segment performance.

##  Tips

- Re-run the cleaning script (01_data_cleaning_marketing_campaigns.sql) whenever new data is added.

- You can expand the analysis by editing 09_combined_channel_segment_analysis.sql.
